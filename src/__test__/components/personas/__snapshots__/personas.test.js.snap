        As a E-Waste Generator, our application enables you to list the various electronic-waste items you want to donate and provides you with different options to donate them either by dropping off or requesting for a pick up. You get to view the different donation drives in your city and can pro-actively participate in the organized drives. You can also keep track of your requests, check how often you donate your e-waste and which kind of waste do you generate the most.

        As an E-Waste Collector , we aim at providing the best possible solution to bridge your access to both the generators and the vendors by enabling you to view, accept or decline the various donation requests, helping you organize an E-Waste drive to have a better presense and good collection and provide you with an interface where you can put up various items for sale and send a request to all the vendors in your city. We aim at giving to the best of both worlds with various performance indicators helping you re-evaluate your progress
